This is a gasket for Pepe Pack by SmooshWorkx (https://github.com/smooshworx/pepe-pack).

It is intended to be inserted between the Pepe Pack housing and the rear panel.
It solves the problem that the carbon cartridge being about 2mm too thick.
It is recommended to be printed in TPU for better seal and noise reduction, although other material should work.

The mesh is generated with OpenSCAD. The `pepe housing mask.stl` was derived from the original Pepe Pack by:

1. Import the housing into SuperSlicer
2. Cut and keep the lower 0.2mm

This is done because the full housing STL is too complex for OpenSCAD to process.
