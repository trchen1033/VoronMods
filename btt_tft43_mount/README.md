## BOM

- BTT TFT43 touchscreen * 1
- M5x10 BHCS * 1
- M3x8 SHCS * 4
- M3x12 SHCS * 4
- M3x40 SHCS * 1
- M3x5x4 heat-set insert * 7
- 2x25mm shaft (may use 1.75mm filament instead) * 2
- M3 T-nut or hammerhead nut * 2
- M5 T-nut or hammerhead nut * 1
- Narrower front skirt pieces. For 350mm printer uses 300mm skirts,
  300mm printer uses 250mm skirts. You'll have to shrink skirts
  by 25mm yourself if you have a 250mm printer.

## Known Issues

- Only supports touchscreen mode. The EXP1/EXP2 connector for
mini12864 emulation mode is blocked by the swival position block.

- Due to lack of major part dimensions on BTT's CAD file, it is
not designed for proper tolerance. It is a snug fit on mine, but
might not fit yours.

2. Install 2 * M3 heat set insert into 2 holes in the center of the rear case.

5. Sandwich BTT TFT43 between the front case and rear case,
